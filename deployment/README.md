Simple Guide to Deploying a Smart Contract

Two Ways to Deploy Your Smart Contract

Option 1: Deploy on a Test Environment

This is perfect for beginners! You only need:

Remix IDE - A free online tool where you can write and test your smart contract

Option 2: Deploy on an Actual Blockchain

This is for when you're ready to go live. You'll need:

Remix IDE - To write your contract
MetaMask wallet - To pay for the deployment
Contract Address - The location of your contract on the blockchain
Contract's ABI - Instructions that help you interact with your contract
Blockchain Explorer - A website to view your contract (like Etherscan)


For Our Tokenizer Project:
                
We're using Option 1 (test environment) since we just want to make sure everything works correctly.
Step-by-Step Guide for Testing:

Open Remix IDE in your web browser
Create a new file called "smartContract.sol"
Copy the smart contract code from our repository and paste it
Click on the "Solidity compiler" tab and compile your contract
Click on the "Deploy & run transactions" tab
Click the "Deploy" button
Your contract is now ready to use in the "Deployed Contracts" section

If You Want to Deploy on the Blockchain (or testnet) :

Follow the same steps in Remix IDE, but select your MetaMask wallet when deploying
After deployment, find your contract on the blockchain explorer (like Etherscan, Bscscan, avascan, ...)
Verify your contract so people can see what it does
Copy your contract's address and ABI (the interface information)
Use your MetaMask wallet's secret key to interact with your contract

The smart contract is now ready to use !
